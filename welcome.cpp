The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. Here's how our version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe differs from the regular thing â€” instead of needing to win a 3 by 3 grid, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe introduces a new 3 by 3 grid. However, this time, instead of filling in \"X\" and \"O\", the spaces are filled up with a 3 by 3 grid (making it a 9 x 9 grid overall), which the players will need to win before getting their \"X\" or \"O\" on the overarching board." << endl; //logic test
