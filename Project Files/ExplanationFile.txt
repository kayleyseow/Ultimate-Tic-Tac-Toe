Introduction to Ultimate Tic Tac Toe:
Have you heard of Tic Tac Toe? Tic Tac Toe is a game where two players, each taking an "X" or "O", take turns marking spaces in a 3 by 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. Here's how our version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe differs from the regular thing â€” instead of needing to win a 3 by 3 grid, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe introduces a new 3 by 3 grid. However, this time, instead of filling in "X" and "O", the spaces are filled up with a 3 by 3 grid, which the players will need to win before getting their "X" or "O" on the overarching board. As they say, 9 times the tic tac toe and 9 times the fun!
