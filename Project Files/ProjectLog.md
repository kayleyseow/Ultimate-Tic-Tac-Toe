# Project Log  
**A log of our progress on this project.**
#### 1/14/2021
- We presented our project in class today
- Kayley added the final finishing touches on `README.md`
#### 1/13/2021
- Discord vc over office hours to finalize project and presentation
- Vincent pushed final commented code in `welcome.cpp`, Kayley renamed file to `ultimateTicTacToe.cpp`
- Kayley renamed repository from `CPP-Project` to `Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe`
- Presentation and code sent to Hoffman, we should be set!
#### 1/12/2021
- We had an hour long Discord vc and started getting the finishing touches done on our project
- Tiffany and Ellen worked on the presentation, waiting until Hoffman gets back to us for the design document
  - Update: no design document needed
- Vincent (Crystal) worked on the final code and formatting
- Kayley worked on organizing all of the files into folders and cleaning up the repository
  - Had to switch to glitch because in the middle of organizing Atom stopped connecting to the repository
#### 1/11/2021
- Vincent continued to work on our huge compiled file
#### 1/10/2021
- Our grind day; had a 2 hour long Discord vc and got a lot of things finished today!
- We decided to not have our final product be made with GUI; we are able to focus on the presentation more
- Created the folder `Individual Functions`
  - Kayley finished writing the tutorial and finished the final version of `tutorial.cpp` to be put into the final program
  - Kayley also finished `introduction.cpp`, to be put into final program as well
  - Ellen pushed her current code of `getPosition.cpp` to master
  - Tiffany pushed her code of `welcome.cpp` to master, basically the backbone of the `main()` function in final program
- Vincent is tasked with compiling everything into the main program
- Ellen, Crystal, and Tiffany started working on the presentation slides
- Kayley did a lot of file organizing and making sure we had everything in place
#### 1/9/2021
- Kayley pushed her code to the repository of `tutorial()`
- `tutorial_command_line.cpp`, as the name suggests, uses the command line, team communication on GUI TBD
- Current code is able to repeat the tutorial for as many times as the user needs
#### 1/4/2021
- Crystal pushed her code to the repository, check `ultimate_tic_toe.cpp`
  - There's also another file called ultimate_tic_toe without the .cpp so might delete that later after confirmation with her
- It is basically the whole game (which can be played through the command line), no GUI yet
#### 11/30/2020
- Group Breakout room during class â†’ Discord vc
- Crystal went over her pseudocode with us, ```winCheck()```
  - Array of arrays
- In order for Mr. Hoffman to check up on our progress, we are adding him to this repo tomorrow morning
#### 11/24/2020
- Group Call on the Discord group vc
- Pseudocode complete
- functions assigned ish
- `winCheck()` function has to check if the board is full/if there is still a possible move (new function for this?) and then check if there is a tie
- `winner()` function is a graphics function that will need to use draw function: screen showing whether X won, O won, there was a tie, or you guys exited the game early
#### 11/12/2020
- Vincent made some pseudocode (unfinished), check `pseudocode.cpp`
- In class, discussed with Hoffman about the structure of our program
#### 11/9/2020
- Kayley finished the Introduction for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe over the weekend on `things.txt`. Thinking of keeping the introduction and the instructions of the game separate as we build it.
- Crystal emailed the Project Notes to Mr. Hoffman this morning.
