> This is our official-ish github repo, not that we have anything done yet.
### Here is a list of things that we need to do.
> feel free to fix this list as fit.
- [ ] Make sure everybody has the ability to access and commit to the repo
- [ ] Figure out what we're going to do
### Messaging platform.
>Messenger (lol we're using discord anyway) for most texting
<br> Discord for calls
<br> If emergency, ping both platforms.
### Editors
do we even need to have a unified development environment??
Name | Yes | No

con| some of us will need to need to move to a different editor | chaotic structure <br> difficulty with collaboration
