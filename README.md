# CPP-Project  
#### Kayley/Crystal/Vincent/Anika  

> This is going to be our official-ish github repo, not that we have anything done yet.
### Here will be tests for making sure that all of have the ability to commit.
- [x] Vincent: "I did a thing"
- [x] Kayley: "Good Morning, Kayley's tryna add somethin :octocat:! trying another commit before going back to class :)"
- [x] Crystal: "Hi guys :D Thank you to Vincent for helping me"
- [ ] Anika: "???"
### Here is a list of things that we need to do.
> feel free to fix this list as fit.
- [x] Make a group
- [ ] Is Ankia part of our group?
- [x] Make sure everybody has the ability to access and commit to the repo
<br>  not Anika though, she hasn't yet
- [ ] Perhaps find out a better way of collaboration
<br>  are we just sticking with github or using something like teletype or liveshare?
<br>  [ ] Teletype
<br>  [ ] LiveSare
<br>  [ ] Just github only
- [ ] do we even need to have a unified development environment??
<br>  [ ] no
<br>  [ ] yes
<br>   > if yes-atom or Visual Studio or VS code? does liveshare work with Visual Studio??
- [ ] Figure out what we're going to do
- [ ] are we sticking with discord?
<br>  [ ] yes
<br>  [ ] no, jump ship to messenger

### Here is a compilation of editors we are okay with.
Name | VS Code | Atom | Other
-----|---------|------|-------
Vincent | eh | yes | have used sublime text and notepad ++ before.
Kayley | Visual Studio, *not* VSCode | With Vincent's help, yes | Sublime Text, dabbled with IntelliJ, has access to the rest of JetBrains anyways
Crystal | yes | not yet | no
Anika | ??? | ??? | ???
### Other things
>Apologies to Kayley, the thing is that Visual Studio looks identical to VS Code.
