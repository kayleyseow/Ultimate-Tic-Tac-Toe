#### Kayley/Crystal/Vincent/Anika  

> This is going to be our official-ish github repo, not that we have anything done yet.
### Here will be tests for making sure that all of have the ability to commit.
- [x] Vincent: "I did a thing"
- [x] Kayley: "Good Morning, Kayley's tryna add smth :octocat:! trying another commit before going back to class :)"
- [x] Crystal: "Hi guys :D Thank you to Vincent for helping me"
- [ ] Anika: "???"
### Here is a list of things that we need to do.
> feel free to fix this list as fit.
- [x] Make a group
- [ ] Make sure everybody has the ability to acsess and commit to the repo
- [ ] Perhaps find out a better way of collaboration
- [ ] do we even need to have a unified development environment??
- [ ] Figure out what we're going to do

### Other things ("messaging board")
- do we need a better method of collaboration like using LiveShare or Teletype?
