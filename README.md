## About
**Semester Project for the CS-102: Introduction to Programming Using C++ Class.**  
This repository contains all the materials and files we created and used for this semester project. Over the course of the semester, we all worked together in order to implement a fully playable game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. Here is an introduction to the game itself:
> Tic Tac Toe is a game where two players, each taking an "X" or "O", take turns marking spaces in a 3 by 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. Here is how our version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe differs from the regular thing â€” instead of needing to win a 3 by 3 grid, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe introduces a new 3 by 3 grid. However, this time, instead of filling in "X" and "O", the spaces are filled up with a 3 by 3 grid (making it a 9 x 9 grid overall), which the players will need to win before getting their "X" or "O" on the overarching board.
