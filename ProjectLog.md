Think of this as a place to track down progress and plan for goals for the final product. Hopefully it will lead to less confusion :).    
## Goals
- add forcequit functions (forfeiture)

- [ ]```welcome()```
- easy, but needs graphics
- [ ]```tutorial()```
- uses draw function and lots of code, plus some text.
- should be pretty chill after draw gets figured out
- [ ]```winCheck()```
- deals with the arrays
- actually two functions
- make sure to take into account ties (big board)
- math
- [ ]```getPos()```
- calculates difference between the arrays.
- math
- [ ]```draw```
- fuck
- [ ]```winner()```
- similar to welcome.
- [ ]```input```
- pretty painful, need to figure out draw first, then use mouse position probably. or use text input, idk

- [ ] Read up on C++ Graphics Docs
- [ ] How are we going to divide up the work?

## Progress  
#### 20-11-24
- Pseudocode complete
#### 11/12/2020
- Vincent made some pseudocode (unfinished), check [pseudocode.cpp](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/pseudocode.cpp)  
- In class, discussed with Hoffman about the structure of our program
#### 11/9/2020
- Kayley finished the Introduction for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe over the weekend on [things.txt](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/things.txt). Thinking of keeping the introduction and the instructions of the game separate as we build it.
- Crystal emailed the Project Notes to Mr. Hoffman this morning.
