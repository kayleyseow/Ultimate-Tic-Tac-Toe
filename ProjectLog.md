## Progress  
#### 20-11-24
- Pseudocode complete
#### 11/12/2020
- Vincent made some pseudocode (unfinished), check [pseudocode.cpp](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/pseudocode.cpp)  
- In class, discussed with Hoffman about the structure of our program
#### 11/9/2020
- Kayley finished the Introduction for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe over the weekend on [things.txt](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/things.txt). Thinking of keeping the introduction and the instructions of the game separate as we build it.
- Crystal emailed the Project Notes to Mr. Hoffman this morning.
