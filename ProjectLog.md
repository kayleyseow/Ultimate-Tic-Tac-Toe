# Project Log
#### because markdown is just so much better than plain text 😌...ˢᵒʳʳʸ ᵛᶦⁿᶜᵉⁿᵗ  
Think of this as a place to track down progress and plan for goals for the final product. Hopefully it will lead to less confusion :).    
## Goals  
- [ ] Starter code for project
- [ ] Read up on C++ Graphics Docs
- [ ] How are we going to divide up the work?

## Progress  
### 11/9/2020
-Vincent made some pseudocode (unfinished)
- Kayley finished the Introduction for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe over the weekend on [things.txt](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/things.txt). Thinking of keeping the introduction and the instructions of the game seperate as we build it.
- Crystal emailed the Project Notes to Mr. Hoffman this morning. Here's a taste:  
  >   We are planning on doing Ultimate Tic Tac Toe for our project. We were planning out how we wanted the start screen to look like.
We have an introduction written out that will display when you start the game:
Introduction to Ultimate Tic Tac Toe:
Have you heard of Tic Tac Toe? Tic Tac Toe is a game where two players, each taking an "X" or "O", take turns marking spaces in a 3 by 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. Here's how our version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe differs from the regular thing — instead of needing to win a 3 by 3 grid, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe introduces a new 3 by 3 grid. However, this time, instead of filling in "X" and "O", the spaces are filled up with a 3 by 3 grid, which the players will need to win before getting their "X" or "O" on the overarching board.  

  >   Then, we will ask if the user wants instructions for the game. If yes, we will display the instructions (currently a work in progress as we are writing it out; this may also change slightly depending on if we end up changing our minds on using graphics or not for the game board.) If not, the program will display the game board and start the game.
We are planning on trying to use graphics for the game board, where you will click on a square to mark that square with an "X" or "O". As the game progresses, if the user clicks on a square that doesn't follow the rules, he/she will be told that the move is invalid and will be prompted to try again.
