# Project Log  
## Goals
#### array functions
- [ ] ```winCheck()```
- deals with the arrays
- actually two functions
- make sure to take into account ties (big board)
- math
- Crystal
- [ ] ```getPos()```
- calculates difference between the arrays.
- math
- Ellen
#### graphics functions
- [ ] ```welcome()```
- easy, but needs graphics
- Tiffany
- [ ] ```draw```
- fuck
- Vincent
- [ ] ```tutorial()```
- uses draw function and lots of code, plus some text.
- should be pretty chill after draw gets figured out
- Kayley? maybe idk ask later
#### everything things, fuck
- [ ] ```winner()```
- similar to welcome.
- [ ] ```input```
- pretty painful, need to figure out draw first, then use mouse position probably. or use text input, idk
- [ ] add forcequit functions (forfeiture)

## Progress
#### 11/30/2020
- Group Breakout room during class â†’ Discord vc
- Crystal went over her pseudocode with us, ```winCheck()```
  - Array of arrays
- In order for Mr. Hoffman to check up on our progress, we are adding him to this repo tomorrow morning
#### 11/24/2020
- Group Call on the Discord group vc
- Pseudocode complete
- functions assigned ish
- Kayley what function do you want to do
- winCheck function has to check if the board is full/if there is still a possible move (new function for this?) and then check if there is a tie
- winner function is a graphics function that will need to use draw function: screen showing whether X won, O won, there was a tie, or you guys exited the game early
#### 11/12/2020
- Vincent made some pseudocode (unfinished), check [pseudocode.cpp](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/pseudocode.cpp)  
- In class, discussed with Hoffman about the structure of our program
#### 11/9/2020
- Kayley finished the Introduction for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe over the weekend on [things.txt](https://github.com/kayleyseow/CPP-Project/blob/master/things.txt). Thinking of keeping the introduction and the instructions of the game separate as we build it.
- Crystal emailed the Project Notes to Mr. Hoffman this morning.
